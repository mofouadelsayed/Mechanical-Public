# Mechanical-Public

In this project, the company wanted to build a prediction model to optimize the use of raw materials in manufacturing. They needed to reduce costs by reducing the use of the most expensive raw material in the manufacturing process without compromising the mechanical properties of their product. However, the cost of achieving this goal by trial & error would have been enormous as each trial costs around $100,000. 
​
To achieve this goal, I used R to explore the manufacturing data including chemical compositions & the resulting mechanical properties to build a linear regression prediction model.
​
The result was a 64% reduction in the most expensive raw material used in manufacturing without compromising the mechanical properties.

Details of the code & the final PDF report are in my GitHub repository linked to the image & the title of this project. This repository contains a PDF report & an Rmd file.
